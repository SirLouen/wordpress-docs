## 6. Questions/Blockers

- [SirLouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/SirLouen) first raised the recurring issue about the lack of a place for test team members to comment on improvement ideas and proposed a solution to use [the following site](https://test.wp.voz.cat/share/s/ideas/p/about-meetings-protocol-Xl7h0JnhDf) to add ideas and comments for future meetings. You can see the topics without registering, but if you want to propose new topics, you can send a direct message to [@SirLouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/SirLouen) in the [Slack server](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C0123456789) with an email address to add you. 
- [Krupa](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda) proposed another additional approach to add ideas for next meetings: A thread will be opened 2 days before each meeting in the [#core-test Slack channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/core-test/), and you can add  your ideas there.

## 7. Call for testers/visibility:

- Checkout the [Bug Scrub Schedule for WordPress 6.8](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2025/03/25/bug-scrub-schedule-for-wordpress-6-8/)

## 8. Open Floor

 - [SirLouen](https://profiles.wordpress.org/SirLouen) first raised an issue about the testing workflow implementation gap, insufficient test reports, QA concerns and a lack of an stable testing team, and proposed a solution: Introducing an unofficial mentorship program to help new contributors get involved in testing [more details here](https://test.wp.voz.cat/share/s/ideas/p/unofficial-mentorship-program-ePhW1o3sum), with the primary goal of building a stable testing team that could be referenced similar to the core team, editor team, or performance team.
 - [OGlekler](https://profiles.wordpress.org/oglekler) noted that testing is being promoted in Core Contributor meetings and suggested to promote testing in other places as well. We will do a brainstorming session to discuss this. Here is a [thread to brainstorm the ideas](https://test.wp.voz.cat/share/s/ideas/p/brainstorming-test-team-outreach-wa3zWVbwDL). Also mentioned that the previous success with the Contributor Mentorship Program came from social media promotion and pointed out the challenge with maining volunteer motivation and commitment over time.
 - [Krupa](https://profiles.wordpress.org/krupajnanda) acknowledged the need for a structured testing workflow and stable team but volunteer participation can be a challenge and the suggested mentorship program had potential to be a stepping stone for new contributors to get involved in testing. More insights are needed to ensure proposed changes are both sustainable and practical.
